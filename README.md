# hello-world
my first repo

This github contains every project that I have done over my college years and professional career.

Iâ€™m currently enrolled in Bachelor of Science in Computer Science program under the Computer Science and Engineering Department at The University of Texas at Arlington. I am also working on a minor in Mathematics. 

My technical qualifications include intermediate proficiency in Java, C, C++, beginner proficiency in Matlab and SQL and  familiar with Assembly programming and MIPS. I am well adept at programming algorithms and data structures, software engineering principles, operating systems and database systems. I have worked with the GUIs of GTKMM and Ncurses.
